These scripts are used to generate an installer for the drivers and
programs that are useful in a Windows guest using SPICE. Currently this
includes spice-vdagent (for copy and paste support among lots of other
things), the QXL video driver and the vioserial driver (which vdagent
needs).
This script installs these progams/drivers and then makes sure they are
started up/picked up correctly by Windows.

This script needs to have the various binaries/drivers it will install
available, they are not included in this archive. The various 'File'
directives in spice-guest-tools.nsis should give you an idea of the
directory tree the script expects. There are some rough notes about this
in INSTALL as well.

To build the final installer, I'm using the mingw32-nsis package from
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MinGW/CrossCompilerFramework#Development_and_testing_repository
(but this should be available directly from the official Fedora
repositories starting with Fedora 17 or 18). Once this is installed, all
that is needed is to run makensis ./spice-guest-tools.nsi from your Linux
box, and magic will happen!
